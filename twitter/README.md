## Architecture Diagram

In this updated representation, the key components are:

- Twitter Data: The JSON file containing Twitter data serves as the input for sentiment analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: This component performs sentiment analysis using Python and the NLTK library. It takes the tweet text as input and generates sentiment analysis results.
- Sentiment: This component assigns sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) to each tweet based on the sentiment analysis results.
- Docker Container: The entire application, including Python, NLTK, and any necessary dependencies, is containerized using Docker. It provides a portable and isolated environment for running the sentiment analysis application.
